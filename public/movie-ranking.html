<h1>The Best Movies According to Me</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring</h3>
<p>It's the start of an amazing trilogy</p>

<h3>Lord of the Rings: Two Towers</h3>
<p>This list is not in a particular order. I am a sucker for LOTR.</p>

<h3>Lord of the Rings: Return of the King</h3>
<p>This series is probably my comfort film series.</p>
